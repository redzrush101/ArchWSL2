## Features and important information
ArchWSL2 may not properly load the Intel WSL driver by default which makes it impossible to use the D3D12 driver on Intel graphics cards. This is because the Intel WSL driver files link against libraries that do not exist in Archlinux. You can manually fix this issue using `ldd` to see which libraries they are linked, eg: `ldd /usr/lib/wsl/drivers/iigd_dch_d.inf_amd64_49b17bc90a910771/*.so`, and then try installing the libraries marked `not found` from the Archlinux package repository. If the corresponding library file is not found in the package repository, it may be that the version suffix of the library file is different, such as `libedit.so.0.0.68` and `libedit.so.2`. In such a case, you can try to create a symlink.

ArchWSL2 has the following features during the installation stage.
* Increase virtual disk size from the default 256GB
* Create a new user and set the user as default
* ArchWSL2 supports systemd using diddledani's [one-script-wsl2-systemd](https://github.com/diddledani/one-script-wsl2-systemd). You can do a minimal setup using [this](https://github.com/diddledani/one-script-wsl2-systemd#minimal-manual-installation) procedure.
* ArchWSL2 includes a wsl.conf file which only has [section headers](https://i.postimg.cc/MZ4DC1Fw/Screenshot-2022-02-02-071533.png). Users can use this file to configure the distro to their liking. You can read more about wsl.conf and its configuration settings [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config).

## Requirements
* For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.
* For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or higher, with Build 19041 or higher.
* Builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2.
* If you are running Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, you can install all components required to run wsl2 with a single command. This will install ubuntu by default. More details are available [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/install-wsl-with-a-single-command-now-available-in-windows-10-version-2004-and-higher/).
	```cmd
	wsl.exe --install
	```
* If you are running Windows 10 lower then version 2004, follow the steps below. For more details, check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) microsoft document.
	* Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux feature.
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
	```
	* Enable Virtual Machine feature
	```cmd
	dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
	```
	* Download and install the latest Linux kernel update package from [here](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).

## How to install
* Make sure all the steps mentioned under "Requirements" are completed.
* [Download](https://github.com/sileshn/ArchWSL2/releases/latest) installer zip
* Extract all files in zip file to same directory
* Set version 2 as default. Note that this step is required only for manual installation.
  ```dos
  wsl --set-default-version 2
  ```
* Run Arch.exe to extract rootfs and register to WSL

**Note:**
Exe filename is using the instance name to register. If you rename it you can register with a diffrent name and have multiple installs.

## How to setup
ArchWSL2 will ask you to create a new user during its first run. If you choose to create a new user during the first run, the steps below are not required unless you want to create additional users.

Open Arch.exe and run the following commands.
```dos
passwd
useradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash <username>
echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL" >/etc/sudoers.d/wheel
passwd <username>
exit
```

You can set the user you created as default user using 2 methods.

Open Arch.exe, run the following command (replace username with the actual username you created).
```dos
sed -i '/\[user\]/a default = username' /etc/wsl.conf
```

Shutdown and restart the distro (this step is important).

(or)

Execute the command below in a windows cmd terminal from the directory where Arch.exe is installed.
```dos
>Arch.exe config --default-user <username>
```

Sometimes updates may fail to install. You can try the command below in such a situation.
```dos
$sudo pacman -Syyuu
```

You may need to install a newer release if additional features have been added/removed from the installer.

## How to uninstall instance
```dos
>Arch.exe clean

```

## How to backup instance
export to backup.tar.gz (WSL1 or 2)
```cmd
